

There are 5 python scripts in the project application for NLP analysis on pdf files:

1. Text_summariser_example.py: this is the main script
2. sentiment_analysis.py: outputs inferred sentiment (one of the 3 states)
3. Language_detection.py: detects the language of the text in question.
4. Full_translator.py: performs full length translation using the Google api
5. named_analysis.py: performs named entity recognition on the text


Please ensure that all imported modules in all of the scripts listed above are installed before running. The main script will
not work otherise.
